      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>My keychain is a simple but essential collection of keys & accessories attached to a sturdy Lululemon wristlet. Each key represents a different aspect of my daily life like home and transportation.</p>
      
      <p>The keychain itself has evolved over time. I've added and removed things as my life has changed, but the core trio of keys, wallet, and airpods has remained constant. </p>

      <h3>Why I Can't Leave Home Without Them</h3>
      <p>Keys are the ultimate necessity. Without them, I literally cannot access the most important places in my life. No house keys means I'm locked out of my home. No car keys means I'm stranded or dependent on others for transportation. No wallet means I won’t have my identification or money.</p>
