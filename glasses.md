      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>These are my daily prescription glasses with a sleek black frame and stripes on the side.</p>
      
      <p>The frames are lightweight yet durable, made from a flexible material that can withstand the occasional drop or sit upon situation. I've had these for about two years, and they've been my faithful companions when I don’t want to wear contacts.</p>

      <h3>Why I Can't Leave Home Without Them</h3>
      <p>Without my glasses, the world is a blur. I'm quite nearsighted, which means I can see clearly up to about 2 feet away, but everything beyond that becomes really fuzzy. Driving would be impossible, reading street signs would be a challenge, and I wouldn't be able to recognize people's faces from across a room. I've learned to always check for them before leaving home, and I keep a backup pair in my car just in case. That's how crucial they are to my daily life. </p>
